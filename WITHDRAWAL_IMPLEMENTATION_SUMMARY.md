## 🔧 Required Backend APIs

### 1. Create Withdrawal Request
```http

{
  "userId": "string",
  "amount": number,
  "currency": "string"
}
```

### 2. Get User's Withdrawal Requests

GET /v1/wallet/withdrawal/requests/:userId
```

### 3. Get All Withdrawal Requests (Admin)
```http
GET /v1/wallet/withdrawal/requests
```

### 4. Process Withdrawal Request (Approve/Reject)
```http
POST /v1/wallet/withdrawal/process
{
  "requestId": "string",
  "action": "approve|reject",
  "reason": "string (optional)"
}
```

### 5. Get Withdrawal Request by ID
```http
GET /v1/wallet/withdrawal/request/:requestId
```

## 💳 Stripe Integration Requirements

### Database Schema
```javascript
{
  id: String, // MongoDB ObjectId
  userId: String, // Reference to User
  amount: Number, // Amount in cents
  currency: String, // 'usd', 'eur', 'gbp'
  status: String, // 'pending', 'approved', 'rejected', 'completed', 'failed'
  createdAt: Date,
  updatedAt: Date,
  stripeTransferId: String, // Stripe transfer ID
  reason: String, // Admin reason for approval/rejection
  stripeAccountId: String // User's Stripe Connect account ID
}
```

### Stripe Transfer Creation
```javascript
const transfer = await stripe.transfers.create({
  amount: request.amount, // Amount in cents
  currency: request.currency,
  destination: request.stripeAccountId, // User's connected account
  description: `Withdrawal for ${request.userName}`,
  metadata: {
    withdrawal_request_id: request.id,
    user_id: request.userId
  }
});
```

### Webhook Handling
```javascript
// Handle transfer.succeeded webhook
app.post('/webhook/transfer-succeeded', async (req, res) => {
  const event = req.body;
  
  if (event.type === 'transfer.succeeded') {
    const transfer = event.data.object;
    
    // Update withdrawal request status
    await WithdrawalRequest.findByIdAndUpdate(
      transfer.metadata.withdrawal_request_id,
      {
        status: 'completed',
        stripeTransferId: transfer.id,
        updatedAt: new Date()
      }
    );
    
    // Update user's wallet balance
    await Wallet.findOneAndUpdate(
      { userId: transfer.metadata.user_id },
      { $inc: { balance: -transfer.amount / 100 } }
    );
  }
  
  res.json({ received: true });
});
```

## 🔒 Security & Validation

### Validation Rules
1. **Minimum Withdrawal**: $10 USD
2. **Maximum Withdrawal**: User's current wallet balance
3. **Currency Support**: USD, EUR, GBP
4. **User Requirements**: Must have completed Stripe Connect onboarding
5. **Balance Check**: Ensure sufficient funds before approval

### Security Measures
1. **Authentication**: All endpoints require valid JWT tokens
2. **Authorization**: Admin endpoints require admin privileges
3. **Rate Limiting**: Implement rate limiting on withdrawal requests
4. **Audit Logging**: Log all withdrawal activities
5. **Fraud Prevention**: Implement additional verification for large amounts

## 🎨 UI/UX Features

### User Interface
- ✅ Modern, responsive design
- ✅ Real-time validation feedback
- ✅ Loading states and progress indicators
- ✅ Success/error message handling
